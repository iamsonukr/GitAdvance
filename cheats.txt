--------- Git basics ------------------
1 > Initialize the git ---
git init 

2> Adding files ---
All files
git add .

particular file 
git add jinga.js

3> Stage the code to push
git commit -m "message" 

4> Showing changes made
git diff

5> Show all commits
git log

6> Show all changes in particular commit 
-> git log
-> select the id of particular commit
-> git show 43dd34

7> Check which memeber has made which changes in a file
git blame filename

Files get modified -> Get to the staging area -> files get pushed

-----------Rerverting----------------------------------
Reverting is the way of moving the head from the current commit to the previous commits. After making any unsuitable changes.

----METHOD ONE ------
1> Get the all comits 
2> Reset the code . This will immediatly reset the code to previous commit and you will loose all new commit 

git log --oneline
git reset --hard 4dfe3

// we should maintain a clean commit history.
Dont push all the changes in a single commit . Complete one functionality then commit.
